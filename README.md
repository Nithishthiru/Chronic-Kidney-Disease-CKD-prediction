# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction 🩺💻

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease using patient health metrics.

## 📁 Files
- `ckd_prediction.ipynb`: End-to-end notebook with data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages.

## 🧪 Technologies & Methods
- **Language**: Python
- **ML Models**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Other**: Data imputation, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning

## 📈 Results
- Achieved high accuracy and precision in detecting CKD early.
- Models were evaluated using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and classification report.

## ⚙️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
